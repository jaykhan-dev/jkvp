# Music

I first caught the music bug when I saw a live Rock N' Roll performance.  I must have been about 11 but I remember the day like it was yesterday. 
I didn't know it at the time, but it was a Beatles cover band.  The first song they played was [She Loves You]() and I remember I had goosebumps. 
It was like someone had turned on a lightbulb in a dark room, or the clouds had parted and the sun rays lit up a valley after a thunderous storm.

Long story short, I begged my parents for a guitar and have been learning music ever since.
