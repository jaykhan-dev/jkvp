# Music

I first caught the music bug when I saw a live Rock N' Roll performance.  I must have been about 11 but I remember the day like it was yesterday. 
I didn't know it at the time, but it was a Beatles cover band.  The first song they played was [She Loves You]() and I remember I had goosebumps. 
It was like someone had turned on a lightbulb in a dark room, or the clouds had parted and the sun rays lit up a valley after a thunderous storm.

## Production

I use Ableton for all my compositions, arrangement, mixing and mastering.  With a Bass Station II, which is a great bass synth, the limitations are 
only in the imagination (or the soundbank).
