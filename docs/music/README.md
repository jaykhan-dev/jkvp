# Music

I first caught the music bug when I saw a live Rock N' Roll performance.  I must have been about 11 but I remember the day like it was yesterday. 
I didn't know it at the time, but it was a Beatles cover band.  The first song they played was [She Loves You]() and I remember I had goosebumps. 
It was like someone had turned on a lightbulb in a dark room, or the clouds had parted and the sun rays lit up a valley after a thunderous storm.

## Blockchain

[Endeavr](/work/blockchain/endeavr/README.md) is the main project related to music and blockchain that is based around my production work.

I plan on using the Algorand blockchain to conduct music business.  It is the way forward because traditional systems have failed us.  It is very difficult for new and upcoming artists to gain any foothold in the current climate of centralized powers, and large corporations like Universal which own so much of the music output these days.  It is a far better policy to deal with fans directly.  

The simple idea of owning a song with the artist is revolutionary in itself.  Writers can be sure that their creations can be traded in a trustless manner, in other words there is no need for middlemen and third parties who always take a large cut of the profits to line their pockets and leave the artist with peanuts.

## Production

I use Ableton for all my compositions, arrangement, mixing and mastering.  With a Bass Station II, which is a great bass synth, the limitations are 
only in the imagination (or the soundbank).
