## Project Details

This project is a collaboration with a friend who is developing the backend logic. He is working with the Plaid API, CSV files, C#, and Mudblazor.

The premise of the application is to help regular people with budgeting. This is achieved by importing data from a bank account and uploading it to the application for analysis. The idea is to make it intuitive and easy to look at the data point and find some insight or organization in managing finances.

My role is UI/UX which involves creating wireframes, user flows, and maybe using Vue JS for the frontend but that is still to be decided.

## Wireframes

## User Flows

The user flow is about uploading sample data to play around with.
