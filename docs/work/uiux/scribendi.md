### A Canadian company which specializes in English Editing and Proofreading

## About the company

Scribendi specializes in editing and proofreading English documents. It could be anything from a resume to a thesis. They have freelancers/professionals around the world who upload their changes onto the website. The website is what I worked on as a UI/UX designer.

Below is a graphic design project for an article on AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP). I met the individual who was responsible for NLP and he used Python which seems like a natural language to work with machine learning.

### Motion graphics

Using Adobe After Effects, I created a bunch of videos which received over 500,000 views all together. 

## New home page design

In order to modernize the style, I went with a graphic oriented design that could then be animated. Stock photos have one drawback, which is that they are stock. I've seen the same stock photo for several different businesses, and people only faintly notice it because of how generic they look. If you are a company that you want to rebrand, I'd suggest keep stock photos to a minimum.

## Design for a new service

The company created a new service and asked for a design. The below screen was again more graphic oriented, with less text. Research has shown that visitors to the site don't like to read a novel, even if they are writers. They need a service, and that is why there are at your website. Always make it easy for the user to interact with the website.

The company decided to expand into China. This was at a time when relations weren't so bad, around 2019, but cracks were starting to appear. I made this with an artistic mindset, to step outside the comfort-zone and create a new look and feel. What I researched of Chinese sites brought to light that a busy site is what the East Asian consumer expects. Being Asian I can that this is a general assumption to make, but one that reflects the reality of living in Asia's major cities.

English is seen as a good skill to have in the international market which is why parents and students will spend money to learn it and have it edited.
