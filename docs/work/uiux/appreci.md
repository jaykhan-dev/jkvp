## Project details

[Official site](https://appreci.io)

Appreci is a company in Australia. Their business model is centered around sending gifts to colleagues or friends as a way of showing appreciation and gratitude.  The benefit of this is to build trust which is essential to any functioning organization.

They have partnered with local businesses to grow their business and make the process of gifting easy and memorable.

>Appreci is a facilitator of team engagement. We offer a fun, digital experience in a tangible, meaningful way. It may only seem like a small gift, but the impact is great.

### How it works

1. Customer signs up on the main portal
2. Choose the items to be sent as a gift
3. Find the person either through email or their name if they are already in the database
4. Recipient can redeem a gift card or get the gift delivered to their address


## Technology
I used Vue JS to build the landing page. By hosting the site on Netlify, it loads quickly and the user experience feels smoother.  

The company uses WordPress for the main site where the customer can sign up, and a Shopify store to sell their products.

## Main competitor

Similar in concept but with a stronger focus on the mobile app.  Their strenghts include marketing by using social media to drive engagement.
