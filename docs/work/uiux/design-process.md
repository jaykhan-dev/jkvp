# Design Process

I have boiled down my design process into 5 steps. 

## 1. Empathize
The first and most important part of the design process is to have empathy for the user. This means that if it's possible to put a face and a name to the potential user, it becomes easier to understand what the user needs.  A common way to do this is to create [persona maps]() that highlight the background, technical skills, needs and wants, and goals of the user.  

Without empathy, any design will feel like a shot in the dark. This usually results in lost revenue and a bad reputation of the product. 

### Inspiration
Design inspiration can come from *anywhere*.  It is so often the case that daydreaming and just wandering for the sake of it can lead to new and novel ideas.  However, it is important to note that keeping an open mind, eyes and ears is the key to finding the best ideas.  A design must be **focused** but the inspiration can be derived randomly by interacting with the world.

### Steve Jobs
I admire Steve Jobs for this design philosophy and it has certainly influenced me in my career. I've used Apple, Microsoft and Linux products and would pick Apple (and Linux) any day because of how carefully thought out the designs are.  The designs are easy and simple to use and they hide the complexity really well.

1. Empathy
>An "intimate" connection with the customer’s feelings. "We will truly understand their needs better than any other company."

2. Focus
>In order to do a good job of those things that we decide to do, we must eliminate all of the unimportant opportunities.

3. Impute
>“People DO judge a book by its cover. We may have the best product, the highest quality, the most useful software etc.; if we represent them in a slipshod manner, they will be perceived as slipshod; if we present them in a creative, professional manner, we will impute the desired qualities. “

### Simplicity

>Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.

The key to success.  No user wants to go through loops and ladders just to buy a simple product.  Apple products are easy to use, and it would take about 10 minutes to understand how to use their OS.  Compare that with Windows in which the UX is not as good and with each problem there is hours of researching how to fix something.  In my opinion, the only reason Windows is more popular is because of Microsofts determination to dominate and sell their product rather than create art.

>Regardless of what your ultimate goal is, remember: *the simplest steps are the ones you don’t take.*

## 2. Define
The goals of the project and what you are trying to achieve.  It is important to be as detailed as possible. 

## 3. Ideate and Collaborate
Initial sketches, storyboards, questions, outlines, mock-ups and features.

## 4. Prototype
Create an initial design that is interactive.  Usually with a tool like Adobe XD or Figma.  Sometimes I use Vue JS for rapid prototyping.

## 5. Test
Responsiveness and functionality.
