## Project Details

[See design](https://shaybeas.webflow.io)

The client specializes in turning leads and referrals into actual customers. The business model is unique for real estate. They needed a website in order to look legit. I made it with Webflow because it's fast and being a graphic designer as well, makes building web pages easier.

The cool thing about Webflow is the ability to create Zaps with Zapier. The downside is the price once you want to go live with your own domain. If you have a business idea which will bring in clients, then the price becomes a non-issue.
