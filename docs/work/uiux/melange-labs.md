# Melange Labs
A creative web3 agency

## Project Details

Web3 is creating new opportunities that require either creating brand new systems from scratch, or revamping old ones to fit the current trends in technology.  With the Blockchain, we have a new kind of database that is immutable and most importantly, **public knowledge**. This is precisely what makes it so powerful and disruptive.  

We are used to shady company policies and "Terms of Service" that are written in size 8 font and go on for pages.  I have never sat down and read an entire policy document.  All I want to know is that the company will not abuse their power by selling my data without my knowledge.  Of course, this is a pipedream because *data* is where the money is.
