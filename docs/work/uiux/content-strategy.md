# Content Strategy

***Content is king.***  

### Content lifecycle

- **Strategize**: What is the ***objective*** of creating this content? The ***goal***? What can it be used for?  Let the strategy determine the next steps which once have been cleared up, are easier to take. 
- **Plan**:  The steps to take.  "The road to prosperity or to ruin".  Planning is easier after doing some reconnaissance of the situation.
- **Design**: Create the content to the best of your ability.  Creativity is called for in this space.
- **Publish**: Put the content out their and promote it.  If it is something you believe in, the chances of it succeeding are much higher.
- **Evaluate**: Look at the data, are there any patterns?  Are there areas you can improve?  What can you change?

## Strategies

This topic gets to the heart of the matter for designers and developers. Without a strategy, you only have content.  Taking meaningful actions to obtain a result, to turn ideas into reality is the purpose of creating strategies.  

The following are guidelines to keep in mind:

- Be flexible and adaptable
- Reflect your organization’s goals and user’s needs. 
- Put yourself in the shoes of the user.  A different perspective helps in . 
- Communicate to people in a way that they understand.  
- Be useful. Omit the needless.
- Stay up-to-date with the technology so that you don't fall behind. 
- Accessibility matters. 
- Be consistent. Use a style guide.
- Make it easy to be found. SEO, navigation all make a difference.
- Content should drive design, structure, etc.

| **Determine Structure:** focuses on how content is prioritized, organized, and accessed. | **Identify Policies and Standards**: focuses on the policies, standards, and guidelines that apply to content and its lifecycle. |

## Landing pages

A great way to find organic traffic and also for marketing purposes is to build a landing page that clearly shows what the business is, what the products are and how they can be purchased, or a clear CTA button for logging in and contacting.

I use Vue JS mainly because it's fast to setup, develop and publish.  It doesn't cost me anything and I get to have fun while designing and developing.  A great strategy that works for me. 

### Appreci

Appreci is an Australian company that needed a new landing page with stronger CTA buttons.  I created the following and this worked since the client was happy with it and the site was seeing better results. My design thinking was to make the UX more interactive with scrolling animations while sticking to the style guide.

## Social media

Social media is a powerful tool.  There is old saying in martial arts:

> The pen is mightier than the sword

By connecting directly with customers and users is by and large the most effective way of getting valuable feedback.  The content that goes on social media should be such that it engages people and compels them to leave a message, a like or emoticon.

Result:  With more posts like these, we were able to get more engagement with followers. 

### Rampart
The following posts were made for social media like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and so on.

## Blogs
Blogging is a great way to boost SEO and get more organic traffic.  If users find your site because there is useful content then that is a good sign.

### Endeavr

A sample blog I wrote about Music NFTs.  Blockchain technology facinates me and I wanted to explore the space more and the one art that I am happy to share with the world is music.  This blog goes into detail about the music industry.
Currently this blog is just meant as a test to see how long it would take to write and publish a blog.  In this case it would take about an hour, where about 30-55 minutes would be spent on writing it.  Since the backend is already setup, publishing would just be a matter of finding an appropriate image, cropping it and uploading it.

## Videos
 
### Scribendi

These series of videos were made for education purposes.  The ESL community was the audience that were identified as being the ones most likely to consider watching the short clips of confusing English language concepts. The videos ended up getting thousands of views and so we know that there was a noticeable impact in the outreach for Scribendi.  

Educational videos also show that the organization is willing to give out knowledge for free and that they know what they are talking about.

Result: The grammar videos got over 500,000 views and increased the traffic to the main Scribendi website.  This told us that free educational content can help bring in new customers.  The other videos got thousands of views but didn't really make a difference in terms of website traffic.
