# Design Philosophy
The following philosophies were inspired by past designers and from experience learning about typography, colour theory, and layouts. These are a reminder that when designing, it is better to proceed with deliberation and focus.  Inspiration can come from anywhere but a good design never feels forced.

Design is about problem solving and communication.  Who is the intended audience?  Is the message clear?  These are some of the questions to consider when designing anything. 

## Function over form
- Function will always matter more than what a design looks like
- Good design redefines itself, rapidly
- Design as a cultural artifact

## Empathy and focus
- The user may not always know what they want
- A streamlined design does its job well
- Eliminate that which does not serve the purpose of the design

## Simplicity
- Good design is as little design as possible
- It should be experienced, not seen
- Deconstructivism - break it down and put it back together, differently
- Sometimes it pays to be obvious

## Good design is pleasing
- Aim for the "WOW" factor
- Good design is instantaneously recognized
- Beauty is truth
- People react to a profound sentiment that speaks to our souls
