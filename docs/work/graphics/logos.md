# Logos

## Endeavr
I've always enjoyed pirate stories and shows which is where the inspiration came from.  I tried to keep it simple but also bold. Endeavr is the name of the ship.

## Casa Art Gallery

The client wanted a logo for their new business: an Art Gallery.  I used the idea of a painting broken up into different sizes.

## Conflict Alerts
The logo is a folded map with the exclamation mark to indicate conflict.  Having a hard looking font gives the impression of military conflict.
