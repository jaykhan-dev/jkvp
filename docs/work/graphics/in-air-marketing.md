>In Air Marketing Inc. is a proximity mobile marketing company that enables advertisers to engage prospective customers within contextually relevant environments without the use of an app.

## My role

I was employed on a freelance basis.  I used Adobe Photoshop and After Effects to create graphics and videos.  These were then played on screens that were installed all over Canada in waiting rooms and clinics. The ads played on rotation.  

Sometimes I worked directly with clients and other times there was a simple list of items they wanted and I just had to implement them.

### Logo for a art company

The client wanted a logo for their new business: an Art Gallery.  I used the idea of a painting broken up into different sizes.
