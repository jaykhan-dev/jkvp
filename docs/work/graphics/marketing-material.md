## Marketing material

### Project details
The following projects were material made for marketing and branding purposes.  The tools I used were Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. 

The client would either send in their requests and I would make the design based on that or sometimes it was up to me.  Having creative freedom is the part that I enjoy the most.  I usually search online for inspiration and find something that could work.  Having a reference helps in improving my skills as a designer.
