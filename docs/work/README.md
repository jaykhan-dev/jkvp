# Work

## [UI/UX](/work/uiux/)
With over 3 years of experience, I have learnt about User Experience and how important it is to have empathy for the user.  Simplicity always works.  The examples are numerous but perhaps the most well known is Apple. 

For some projects I have included more details like wireframes, user flows, and prototypes to showcase the design thinking process. 

## [Blockchain](/work/blockchain/)
Perhaps the most revolutionary technology to emerge in the past 20 or so years and one which will only gain more adoption as time passes.  There are many benefits which I highlight in my blog.  

## [Graphic Design](/work/graphics/)
I started my career as a graphic designer making videos, posters, and advertisements.  I eventually decided to work on interactive experiences because of how useful and prevalent it is.  

## [Resume](/work/resume/)
My career has been evolving every year.  Never one to get too comfortable, I have always strived to expand my skills and seek more challenging roles. 

## [Tech Stack](/work/graphics/)
Summary and links to the technology that I use to create interactive designs.
