**BTonic is a web application for **financial freedom**.  Bitcoin is by far the largest and most influential of the blockchains currently running, which is the main focus of this application.  The content includes news articles, Bitcoin data, learning resources, and companies that payout in Bitcoin.**

## Project details

### Background
After exploring the alt-coin scene and investing in crypto, it has become apparent that Bitcoin is the dominant digital asset.  Essentially, this project is devoted entirely to Bitcoin because the idea of having a store of value not controlled by any central authority, and one that can be sent around the world in seconds at a fraction of a cost is clearly the **best choice**.

### Purpose
By learning about and working with companies using Bitcoin and the underlying blockchain technology, one can take control over personal finances and not be subject to the whims of the elite who may decide to change the rules as they wish. 

Bit & Tonic is about financial freedom and Bitcoin is the way to get there.

### Technology stack
- Vue JS
- Tailwind CSS
- Wagtail 
- CoinLore API
- LNURL- AUTH

## UX

### The User
The target audience for this application is anyone who is interested in being financially healthy. The goal of the app is to help both technologically adept and those who are just looking for an alternative method for storing wealth. 

It makes sense to me as a citizen, that I should have self-custody of my money and that is an idea that has a lot of zeal amongst those who have struggled with authoritarian regimes and being bankless in the internet age. 

### Wireframes
The following wireframes are made with Figma.  The goal of learning and finding Bitcoin related jobs is paramount and where each wireframe is aiming for.

#### News

The news consists of the featured article which is the largest block with recommended articles on the side.  Following the top section are the popular news stories based on views and a podcast section because they are very popular these days. Finally, all the other news items appear at the bottom in a smaller format.

#### Data

*There are six panels filled with data from 3rd party APIs like CoinLore.*

- The first has more general information about the blockchain, like supply numbers.  
- The second block is more specific to the price and price changes over a period of time with a chart. 
- The third is a pie chart that compares Bitcoin's dominance as compared to other crypto currencies which came about as a result of blockchain technology. 
- The fourth block is limited to exchanges and their key pairs.  Essentially, this is for those who want to know where to buy Bitcoin easily. 
- The fifth block is strictly about the mining operations with a hashrate and minig pools.
- The final and sixth block are links to other resources such as the official Bitcoin whitepaper written by Satoshi Nakamoto.

A simple layout with the ability to sort by data, category, author, and length (reading/video time).  The articles have a small blurb so that the reader can have an idea of what kind of article this is.
