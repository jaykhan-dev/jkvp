# WooWay
Vue + WordPress + Blockchain

[See Prototype](https://wooway.netlify.app)

![WooWay Hero](/images/work/wooway/wooway-hero.jpg)

## Project Details
WooWay aims to **fill the gap** in the current Web3 market that uses blockchain for finance instead of only the traditional monetary systems. 

Web3 is creating new opportunities that require either creating brand new systems from scratch, or revamping old ones to fit the current trends in technology.  With the Blockchain, we have a new kind of database that is immutable and most importantly, **public knowledge**. This is precisely what makes it so powerful and disruptive.  

## UX 

### Color scheme
I prefer darker colors because it is easier on the eyes.  Dark blue works well with greens and white.  The following colors each have their purpose.

- Purple: Links
- Green: Large headers
- White: regular text
- Dark blue: background color

### Layout

### Target Audience

### Frontend

### Backend

### Blockchain

### User flows

## Technology

- The frontend is made with Vue JS and hosted on a platform like Netlify
- The backendend/CMS is WordPress because of it's massive ecosystem and wide userbase
- Prices and services are listed in Crypto and stablecoins like USDC, USDT

Plugins for WordPress:

- [WooComerce](https://woocommerce.com/)
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-ca)
- [SatoshiPay](https://wordpress.org/plugins/satoshipay/)
- [WP Blockchain](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-blockchain/)

## Blockchain

### Ethereum
With the largest crypto community, dapps, projects, crypto based exchanges and sidechains, Ethereum is important to the evolution of the borderless economy.  With projects like Polygon which reduce gas fees significantly, it is possible to create stores that utilize the vast resources available. 

### Algorand
Algorand is a third generation blockchain that is carbon negative, cheap to use, and blazing fast.  It is still new and so doesn't have the same number of users but the technology is cutting edge. 

### Stablecoins

[USDC](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc) is a popular stablecoin that banks, and monetary systems like Visa are either considering or have adopted.  Though mostly used on the Ethereum blockchain, USDC is also available on Algorand which is preferable due to its low fees and fast block finality (speed at which a transaction is finalized). 

[USDT](https://tether.to/en/) is the largest stablecoin by market cap.

>Tether tokens are the most widely adopted stablecoins, having pioneered the concept in the digital token space. A disruptor to the conventional financial system and a trailblazer in the digital use of traditional currencies, Tether Tokens support and empower growing ventures and innovation throughout the blockchain space. Tether Tokens exist as a digital token built on multiple blockchains.

There are also Canadian stablecoins, but the utility is wanting at the moment.
