Algorand is in my opinion the easiest to use blockchain for minting NFTs and cose is minimal gas fees.

## What are NFTs?

You might have heard of NFTs on the news lately.  It is all the rage in the digital world because it gives a digital work of art a unique identifier.  This is startling because the nature of digital work is that exact copies can be made with little effort.  

So what makes NFTs unique?

**Links.**

An NFT is a link to a work or collection of art.  It's similar to a concert ticket that gets you in the door, but it's not the concert itself.  It is proof that you have the right to see the concert.  Similarily, and NFT proves that you own the collection.  This proof is embedded into the metadata of the digital works.  Metadata can be used to determine who made it, what it's made of and other details that are necessary for proof.
