# NFTs

These are the NFTs I've minted on Algogems (see below).  I am currently working on creating music NFTs with the available platforms on Algorand.  Projected release is summer 2022.

## Algogems

[Algogems](https://algogems.io/)

>Algogems is the open NFT marketplace for the Algorand blockchain. It allows artists to mint and auction their NFT for free, and provides a trading platform for NFT collectors.

Algorand is in my opinion the easiest to use blockchain for minting NFTs and cose is minimal gas fees, security, and most important to me as a UI/UX designer, is Usability.  Algorand provides an easy way to connect to the blockchain, to mint NFTs.  The blockchain is new but it is growing rapidly and ecosystem is expanding everyday.  New projects are being created around the world and exisiting legacy corporations are looking to utilize the cutting edge technology to keep up with the times. 

## What are NFTs?

You might have heard of NFTs on the news lately.  It is all the rage in the digital world because it gives a digital work of art a unique identifier.  This is startling because the nature of digital work is that exact copies can be made with little effort.  

So what makes NFTs unique?

**Links.**

An NFT is a link to a work or collection of art.  It's similar to a concert ticket that gets you in the door, but it's not the concert itself.  It is proof that you have the right to see the concert.  Similarily, and NFT proves that you own the collection.  This proof is embedded into the metadata of the digital works.  Metadata can be used to determine who made it, what it's made of and other details that are necessary for proof. 

## DAO

A [DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization), is short for Decentralized Autonomous Organization.  This is the way forward for new companies and artists that want to participate in the emerging [borderless economy](https://www.algorand.com/resources/blog/the-borderless-economy-is-here).
