# Endeavr

[See live prototype](https://music-endeavr.netlify.app/)

## Project details
Endeavr is a music project on the Algorand blockchain that eliminates the need for middlemen.  The music industry is constantly evolving.  Any new technology appears threatening but eventually it becomes the norm.  A great example in recent times is the creation of the MP3 which makes creating exact digital copies easy, cheap and fast.  Companies like Napster got a lot of heat for sharing music without having to pay for it that it got sued and eventually had to change its business model.  

With the blockchain, music owernship is no longer a problem.  Anyone with an internet connection can invest directly with the artist rather than buy a song through a third party vendor.  To be sure, giant corporations like Universal control a large portion of the copyrights and have considerable power over an artists career.  It is possible to bypass shady record deals by focusing on the *creator-borderless-economy.*

### Branding
This is a logo that I designed with Adobe Illustrator.  The inspiration is a pirate ship on the high seas. I had an idea of putting the Algorand logo on the mast but will probably decide on that at a later time.

### Requirements
- Be able to mint NFTs
- Collaborate with other artists by filling out a form
- Invest in existing projects 
- Earn rewards in crypto
- Purchase merchandising and tickets


### Tech Stack
- The frontend is made with **Vue JS** because it is versatile and the ecosystem has all the tools and libraries required for building robust dapps.  
- The **Algorand blockchain** is an easy to use platform that has made creating and managing digital assets much easier with minimal costs.  
- Any CMS would work for creating an artist page with a list of tracks and NFTs.  I prefer **Django** for the backend because it is powerful and has been around for a while making it a solid choice.

### Ecosystem
The following projects that are part of the Algorand ecosystem and which eliminates the need to create a new system from scratch.  The best strategy is to get to the market with new music faster and more efficiently, rather than spend years trying to build the perfect platform.

- [STOI](https://stoi.org/)
- [Loudefi](https://loudefi.com/)
- [Crescendo](https://crescendocrypto.xyz/)
- [Limewire](https://limewire.com/waitlist)
- [Opulous](https://www.opulous.org/)

## Features

### Invest
By investing in existing NFTs, artists or regular users and fans can participate and even earn crypto.  This is the new way forward made possible by the blockchain.  Historically, every musical group seems to have had issues with their record label taking the lions share of the profits.  Even with streaming services like Spotify, the royalties paid out are peanuts compared to the billions that the company is making. 

**Giving power back to the people is what it's all about.**

### Collaborate
Creating brand new NFTs as a way of producers and writers to split the royalties, masters, ticket sales, and any other kind of merchandise.  By having full control over the music, there is no need for third parties like corporate labels.  Promotion is down to the artists involved and social media. 

### Vote
Quality Assurance for music is useful if you need feedback before releasing a song.  Using a voting mechanism like [Choice Coin](), a user would connect their wallet to login and then choose a list of songs that have been chosen for quality assurance.  

The NFT creator can specify for how long the voting lasts and maybe even a minimum number of votes.  This would all be handled with smart contracts written in either PyTEAL or Reach.
