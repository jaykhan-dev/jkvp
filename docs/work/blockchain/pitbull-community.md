# Pitbull Community

### UI/UX design for the home page request by an Upwork client. Made with Webflow and Vue JS. 

## Project Details

Pitbull Community is a blockchain project that is running on the Ethereum Blockchain.  It is a token that is made for dog lovers (especially Pitbulls), that can be bought on various exchanges in the Ethereum ecosystem.     

My role was to completely redesign their existing homepage and make it more modern.  I was given free reign over the design and so I changed the color scheme, fonts, layout and UI.  It was important to the client that the UX *feel* smooth and easy to navigate.  This was achieved by adding more navigation, and a scrolling experience that revealed more about the company as the user progressed down the page.

## Design tools

### Webflow

I used [Webflow](https://www.webflow.com) in this project because it's intuitive to use. I started my career in Graphic Design, so discovering this software was the hook that set me off on my web journey for real. If feels a bit like Photoshop, but geared towards interactive experiences. Since it comes with a database, it's full stack.

There is a downside which is when you start adding lots of pages, the editor slows down noticeably. For small sites it works great though.

## Tokenomics

The client had all this figured out beforehand. It really helps to have to numbers to build some level of trust because of the old maxim, "Number don't lie".

## Exchanges

Making the token available is crucial to building a community. This token is running on the Ethereum blockchain and is listed on various dex's. I learnt a lot from this project, and will always remember it fondly.
