# Pitbull Community

### UI/UX design for the home page request by an Upwork client. Made with Webflow and Vue JS. Blockchain industry.

## Project Details

This project was fun because it was my first Blockchain, Webflow and Upwork project and the client was happy with the design.

## Design tools

I used [Webflow](https://www.webflow.com) in this project because it's intuitive to use. I started my career in Graphic Design, so discovering this software was the hook that set me off on my web journey for real. If feels a bit like Photoshop, but geared towards interactive experiences. Since it comes with a database, it's full stack.

There is a downside which is when you start adding lots of pages, the editor slows down noticeably. For small sites it works great though.

## Tokenomics

The client had all this figured out beforehand. It really helps to have to numbers to build some level of trust because of the old maxim, "Number don't lie".

## Exchanges

Making the token available is crucial to building a community. This token is running on the Ethereum blockchain and is listed on various dex's. I learnt a lot from this project, and will always remember it fondly.
