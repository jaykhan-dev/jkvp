# Melange Labs
A creative web3 agency

![Melange Labs Vue Ecosystem](/images/work/melangelabs/mlabs-ecosystem.png)

## Project Details
Melange Labs aims to **fill the gap** in the current Web3 market that uses blockchain for finance instead of only the traditional monetary systems. 

Web3 is creating new opportunities that require either creating brand new systems from scratch, or revamping old ones to fit the current trends in technology.  With the Blockchain, we have a new kind of database that is immutable and most importantly, **public knowledge**. This is precisely what makes it so powerful and disruptive.  

## Requirements

- Must be able to setup an online store with Vue Storefront
- The backendend/CMS is separate from the frontend
- Prices and services are listed in Crypto and stablecoins like USDC

- [BigCommerce](https://www.bigcommerce.com/)
- [commercetools](https://commercetools.com/?location=apac)
- [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/)

## Algorand
### Stablecoins

[USDC](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc) is a popular stablecoin that banks, and monetary systems like Visa are either considering or have adopted.  Though mostly used on the Ethereum blockchain, USDC is also available on Algorand this is preferable due to its low fees and fast block finality (speed at which a transaction is finalized). 

There are also Canadian stablecoins, but the utility is wanting at the moment.
