# Melange Labs
A creative web3 agency

[See Prototype](https://melangelabs.netlify.app)

![Melange Labs Vue Ecosystem](/images/work/melangelabs/melangelabs-hero.png)

## Project Details
Melange Labs aims to **fill the gap** in the current Web3 market that uses blockchain for finance instead of only the traditional monetary systems. 

Web3 is creating new opportunities that require either creating brand new systems from scratch, or revamping old ones to fit the current trends in technology.  With the Blockchain, we have a new kind of database that is immutable and most importantly, **public knowledge**. This is precisely what makes it so powerful and disruptive.  

## Requirements

- Must be able to setup an online store with Vue Storefront
- The backendend/CMS is separate from the frontend
- Prices and services are listed in Crypto and stablecoins like USDC, USDT

## Blockchain

### Ethereum
With the largest crypto community, dapps, projects, crypto based exchanges and sidechaines, Ethereum is important to the evolution of the borderless economy.  With projects like Polygon which reduce gas fees significantly, it is possible to create stores that utilize the vast resources available. 

### Algorand
Algorand is a third generation blockchain that is carbon negative, cheap to use, and blazing fast.  It is still new and so doesn't have the same number of users but the technology is cutting edge. 

### Stablecoins

[USDC](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc) is a popular stablecoin that banks, and monetary systems like Visa are either considering or have adopted.  Though mostly used on the Ethereum blockchain, USDC is also available on Algorand which is preferable due to its low fees and fast block finality (speed at which a transaction is finalized). 

[USDT](https://tether.to/en/) is the largest stablecoin by market cap.

>Tether tokens are the most widely adopted stablecoins, having pioneered the concept in the digital token space. A disruptor to the conventional financial system and a trailblazer in the digital use of traditional currencies, Tether Tokens support and empower growing ventures and innovation throughout the blockchain space. Tether Tokens exist as a digital token built on multiple blockchains.

There are also Canadian stablecoins, but the utility is wanting at the moment.
