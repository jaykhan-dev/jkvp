## Web3
Web3 is the era we live in now in terms of the internet.  Techonology evolves and it is imperative that if you want to survive in this rapidly changing world, to
stay on top of things, ride the waves and learn to adapt.  Otherwise, the tide will take you. 

I am actively learning about web3 and how to design accordingly.  The main challenge is adapting blockchain for existing applications.  It is my belief that
companies will want to utilize this powerful technology seeing how slow and expensive traditional financial systems can be.  There is also a matter of trust. 

## Data
The internet is all about data.  In fact so much of ordinary life can be categorized as data in a digital sense.  Learning a programming language always involves learning
about data structures and algorithms.  This is important because if you don't have data, what are you programming?

For personal prjects I like to use [Python](https://www.python.org/) for managing data and creating data models with Django.  This is helped me immensely in understanding how the web works and allows me to create many Vue JS apps to level up my skills by practicing how to design user interfaces and user experiences.
