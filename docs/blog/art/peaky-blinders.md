[IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2442560/)

A TV crime drama set between the two World Wars in Birmingham, England.  It follows the rise of the Shelby family, who are a bunch of gypsies shunned by society at large but through grit and pure determination move up in the world and become very powerful and wealthy.  Led by the charismatic Thomas Shelby, the family faces numerous challenges to their hegemony in Small Heath, a dockyard in the heart of Birmingham.  

There were six seasons in total and the final episode aired on April 3rd, 2022.  I watched the whole series and have to say that it is one of my favourite shows. 

## The Gang
Based on real life gangsters during the aforementioned time period, the [Peaky Blinders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky_Blinders) were known to sew razor blades into their peaked caps.  The writer [Steven Knight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Knight) explained how some of his family were connected to the Peaky Blinders and that is how he came to write a drama that feels authentic.

## Strategy
What attracts me about the show is the strategic nature of Thomas Shelby.  There is a saying that goes

>Hope is not a strategy

which is true for all walks of life.  All hope does is give us a sense of false comfort.  Anyone who wants to achieve anything in life would be better off learning how to strategize because that is by far the most effective way of moving forward.  It is a skill that can be learnt but the best strategists have an innate gift that can change the world, and bring peace and prosperity.  

## Character development
Thomas Shelby is a thinker.  In the first season we see him hide information from his family in order to control the narrative. This eventually makes him indespensible because he gets results.  He sees things that others do not.  This is a sign of a true strategist.  He manages to outwit all his opponents and come out on top.  With each season, the enemy seems more and more dangerous and cunning but still Tommy prevails.  

The conflict within him is like a wild horse and that can't be tamed. At times he acts out of anger and this creates more tension with this family but it never extinguishes the fire inside.  He starts off as a bookie and then becomes head of the family.  His ambitions lead him to run for office and gain a seat in Parliament and rub shoulders with Winston Churchill and Oswald Mosley.  He is a socialist who actually cares about the working class because he rose out of poverty and is in a position to help others. 

In the final few seasons we see him become more paranoid and the cracks begin to appear.  In the third episode of the final season, 'Gold', he goes off to the mountains to find out who put a curse on him that led to his daughters death.  The scenes in the mountains felt oddly familiar as if I had seen the exact same landscape in my own dreams.  I can't explain why, but it definitely struck a chord and I couldn't help but feel the sense of chaos and uncertainty that Tommy felt.  

## Final act
The writing was incredible and it kept me on the edge of my seat because the cinematography and music created plenty of tension but also curiosity.  The final episode was the longest of all and it did not disappoint.  It felt like a western, with gun fights, explosions, death and destruction.  The final scene where he rides off on his white horse as his caravan burns to the ground is poetic and leaves the ending open to more questions. 

I enjoyed the show immensely and it was a saga of a family that went from nothing to having it all.  That is something we can all relate too, in our own way.  With that I leave the final word to the famous line spoken whenever they make a decree:

>By order of the Peaky Blinders
