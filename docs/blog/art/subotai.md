## Aesthetics

Contrast the way Genghis Khan conducted warfare with today.

## Outline

### Part 1: Reconnaissance-in-Force

#### 1. The Great Raid 
*Subotai fails to capture the Shah who escapes to an island in the Caspian sea.  He makes a solitary journey of 1200 km to meet Genghis Khan at his Camp in what was the former Khawarizm Empire.  He tells him of the ‘narrow faced men with blue eyes’ and the world to the west.  And so begins the greatest Cavalry Raid in the history of warfare.*

- Subotai is selecting skilled workers for the Mongol Army when he encounters a captive enemy soldier who wishes to see him before he is executed.  This confuses Subotai momentarily.
- Subotai and Jebe talk
- Borte is managing the Empire from Mongolia.  Burkhan Khaldun, and the wolf motif
- The Shah is attempting his final escape from the Mongol task force sent to kill him. He disappears into the Caspian Sea, never to be seen again by his people.
- Subotai and Jebe talk with new voluntary recruits, an Englishman, and a Venetian
- The task force returns and informs Subotai and Jebe of the Shahs escape.  They talk about a strange new land to the West and how the people have narrow faces, pale skin, and blue eyes. 
- Subotai sends an arrow messenger to Genghis Khan
- Scouts explore new areas (no dialogue)
- Borte talks with one of her daughters.  We see how the children grow, and learn to be warriors
- Chu ji and Genghis Khan talk further
- Subotai and Jebe instruct their men
- Subotai is summoned by Genghis Khan to Samarkand which is thousands of miles away. When Subotai meets with Genghis he mentions a reconnaissance mission around the Caspian Sea
- Special forces appear on the outskirts of the city and each go their own separate ways, one to a tavern, another to a mosque, and so on but they all have one task:  Spread fear and terror about the Mongols.

#### 2. The Dogs of War 
George Lasha III The Brilliant, is troubled by news of foreign horsemen who are ravaging the country side.  He takes up arms against the Barbarians but loses his throne.  

#### 3. Crossing the Abyss
Subotai takes his forces across the Caucasus Mountains, where he is tricked into taking an extra long route, causing significant damage to his resources.  He manages to outwit the coalition force sent to stop him from descending the mountain range.  
 
#### 4. Kievan Rus
Subotai raids villages in Kievan Rus, prompting Mstislav the Bold to form an army to repel the Devil’s horsemen.  He has problems with unifying his army due to internecine conflict.  He eventually forms a force strong enough to take on the Mongols and begins a chase. 

#### 5. Feigned Retreat 
Subotai leaves behind a 1000 man force, led by Jebe, to hold back the Russian force.  Jebe dies, but the Russian army gets strung out over 9 days of chasing. 

#### 6. Kalka River
Subotai forms battle positions on the Kalka river and proceeds to annihilate the entire Russian army sent to stop them.  He travels back to Mongolia where Genghis Khan dies and is buried in a secret location.  In the kurultai, 2 years later, Oegedei sends Batu Khan to conquer the west.  He sends Subotai, the greatest Mongol general, to guide him.
