# Subotai

This is the story of a man who conquered more land, subjugated more people than any other general in history.  His epic real-life journey stretches the breadth of Asia, from the the Pacific Ocean to Central Europe.  An invincible soldier of the Great Khan, Subotai Bagatur leads his army on a path that would forever change the course of history, and give rise to nations that still exist today.  

## Outline

#### 1. The Great Raid 
*Subotai fails to capture the Shah who escapes to an island in the Caspian sea.  He makes a solitary journey of 1200 km to meet Genghis Khan at his Camp in what was the former Khawarizm Empire.  He tells him of the ‘narrow faced men with blue eyes’ and the world to the west.  And so begins the greatest Cavalry Raid in the history of warfare.*

- Subotai and Jebe talk

- Subotai and Jebe talk with new voluntary recruits, an Englishman, and a Venetian
