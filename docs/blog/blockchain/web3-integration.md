# Web3 Integration

## Intro
This document highlights the benefits of using blockchain for small to medium sized businesses. By utilizing blockchain I believe entrepeneurs and startups can gain an edge over traditional businesses who stick with legacy systems.

## How blockchain can help

### Trust

- Smart contracts

>The increased transparency and process visibility provided by blockchain technology help startups to reduce their risk of frauds while also building customer trust and brand image.

- Money transfers and payments

>With blockchain, crypto can be sent to anywhere and anyone in the world without the need for currency exchanging or without interference from central banks.

>Blockchain payment solutions can bridge a gap and open new markets for many business owners.

>Blockchain solutions save costs while simplifying payments

Cost
For this one, you’ll have to pay close attention to the payment gateway you’re using to accept cryptocurrencies. Typically, though, the fees associated with Bitcoin payments tend to be much lower than what you’d have to pay for something like a credit card or PayPal. However, always read the fine print before adding a gateway to your site to ensure there are no hidden fees.

Speed
This kind of “speed” doesn’t have anything to do with WordPress site performance and, instead, has everything to do with the speed at which you’ll get money owed into your account. Because you don’t have to wait for banks and credit card institutions to process the payment, this is a much quicker way to get guaranteed cash from customers.

- Security

### Supply chain

>Customers can trust that where the product comes from is authentic because blockchain technology tracks the goods.

### Rewards and branding

>In addition to regular payments, small businesses can also offer rewards in crypto, which could be a great move for PR purposes and an effective way to attract both new and repeat customers.

### Wider customer base
Being an international monetary system, there are no barriers when it comes to getting paid directly.  With our current banking system, there are long delays () and high fees which make it expensive to use such channels for small transactions.
