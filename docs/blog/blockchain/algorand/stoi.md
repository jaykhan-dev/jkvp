## Song That Owns Itself

[Official Site](https://stoi.org)

I recently came across this **awesome** project.  Ideas like these are exciting because they are using cutting edge technology like the Algorand Blockchain to help
artists be more self-sustaining. As far as I'm concerned, this is the way forward.  The music industry will adjust to this new development.  Antiquated ways of dishing 
royalties and rights are starting to feel the heat.  It makes more sense to share your art directly with your fans because the best marketing is P2P. 

## What is it?

Based on their whitepaper: 
>The Song That Owns Itself reimagines artistic ownership for the digital age and redefines value based on individual experience.

From my understanding, STOI is a new way of owning music. Based on [smart contracts](https://)

>Art wants first to be seen and heard, and second, to be appreciated

## DMC
DMC is a legendary rapper from the pioneering hip-hop group [Run-DMC](http://www.rundmc.com/).  He recently created a song called [Million Scars](https://stoi.org/s/3) which runs on a smart contract on Algorand.  What makes this revolutionary is that fans can own a part of the song in tokens.  This means that if the song does well and earn money, so do the token holders.  In other words, it's in my best interest to promote the song. 

It's projects like these that convinced me that Algorand is simply the best blockchain around.
