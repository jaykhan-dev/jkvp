# Crypto UX

## Canada
Canada is a big market for Crypto but there are challenges to moving money around. These hurdles are making it frustrating to adopt crypto into everyday life. What we need is a solid UX that makes it easy to trade and buy crypto. The main problem seems to be legislation.  There is definitely mistrust by the central authorities about how blockchain is **too** disruptive.  Perhaps the big banks are whispering into the ears of our senators and elected officials about limiting the use of cryptocurrencies.

My preference in blockchain is Algorand.

### KYC
Usually requires a photo ID, a picture from a camera, and birthdate. 

### Exchanges
- Binance no longer supports Ontarians
- Newton doesn't have all the necessary coins [Sunsetting certain coins](https://newtoncrypto.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410881930387-We-re-Sunsetting-XRP-and-USDT)
- The fees for Ethereum are crazy
- Catalyx can't verify my identity
- Uphold doesn't have withdrawal to Algo
- Netcoins is asking for a lot of information and documents which seems unecessary.
