# Ethereum

*The following blog is meant as a reference for learning purposes.* 

[Whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/)

[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/) changed the game by introducing smart contracts.  This allowed developers to program applications using cryptocurrencies whereas Bitcoin has only one utility currently - a store of value.

## Web3
The web is evolving.  It has been ever since it first went [live](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html) on August 6, 1991.  If you take a look, the first website doesn't look like much.  It's just a bunch of text with hyperlinks, but this website changed the world, and here we are more than 30 years later and the landscape would be unrecognizable to those who were there first. 

Regardless of the siesmic changes, the web has created tremendous opportunities for regular people but also created massive corporations which seemingly rule our lives.  We are addicted to the web.  The data, the interactive nature, the social aspect have all upended our lives and now we cannot imagine our lives without the apps that take so much of our attention.  Sometimes it feels good to disengage and take a walk in nature to be human again.  

The biggest change for the web in the past decade or so has been the blockchain and Ethererum has been one of the big names making the web more democratic and decentralized.  It has its problems with high gas fees and energy comsumption but that is all changing with the recent [Merge]().

The following are some characteristics of web3:

- Anyone with an internet connection can be a part of the ecosystem
- No permission is required
- No one can be censored for using the service
- The native currencies are all based on crypto

Where traditional systems can censor and block individuals as they see fit, the blockchain being public knowledge gives power to the people.  Centralized servers can go down and with it all its data and usefulness, whereas blockchain apps are immune to such power failures or cyber attacks.  The clue is in the world 'crypto' which is short for cryptography.  

Web3 is slowly becoming more mainstream.  Some cool projects include:
 
- [Brave browser](https://brave.com/)
- [Decentr](https://decentr.net/)

This is by no means a exhaustive list, and I will be adding more projects here as I discover and learn more about them. 

### web.js
[Official docs](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.7.1/)

This library is a good way to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and sign transactions, amongst other utilities. It requires that you be connected to an Ethereum node.  This could be achieved by downloading the entire blockchain onto your computer or by using a third party like [Infura](https://infura.io/), or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) as a proxy. 

The full node can take time and use a lot of computing power because the blockchain for Ethereum is massive at this point.  See [transactions chart](https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_transactions_per_day).

### ether.js
[Official docs](https://docs.ethers.io/ethers.js/v3.0/html/)

Another library that makes it easier to use interact with the Ethereum blockchain using JavaScript.

From their official page:

> This library (which was made for and used by ethers.io) is designed to make it easier to write client-side JavaScript based wallets, keeping the private key on the owner’s machine at all times.

## Smart Contracts
[Intro to smart contracts on the official webpage](https://ethereum.org/en/smart-contracts/)

>Smart contracts are the fundamental building blocks of Ethereum applications. They are computer programs stored on the blockchain that allows us to convert traditional contracts into digital parallels. Smart contracts are very logical - following an if this then that structure. This means they behave exactly as programmed and cannot be changed.

A contract is just an agreement.  A smart contract is a digital version of that using cryptocurrencies.  You don't need to be a lawyer to understand it, however being a developer would certainly help. 

 When two people decide they want to sell/buy something and want to use the blockchain, a smart contract is the app that makes it happen.  it can be programmed in any manner that the two parties see fit.  For example, if a certain item is sold, the corresponding value in crypto is released to the seller.  

### Solidity
[Official website](https://soliditylang.org/)

Ethereum has its own language to write smart contracts called Solidity.  I'm more interested in [Python](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/programming-languages/python/) and [Javascript](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/programming-languages/javascript/), both of which can be used to interact and develop smart contracts on Ethereum. 

>Solidity is a curly-bracket language designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It is influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript. You can find more details about which languages Solidity has been inspired by in the language influences section.

## NFTs
Non Fungible Tokens have taken the digital world by storm.  Where traditional digital assets can be copied as exact replicas, NFTs have meta data that make each one unique.  This is great for artists and digital creators and will certainly stimulate the creator economy.    

>NFTs are tokens that we can use to represent ownership of unique items. They let us tokenise things like art, collectibles, even real estate. They can only have one official owner at a time and they're secured by the Ethereum blockchain – no one can modify the record of ownership or copy/paste a new NFT into existence.

There has been recent controversy regarding NFTs because if you watch/read the news, you may have seen how some image is being sold for millions of dollars.  It certainly makes one wonder what the point of buying an image for such exorbitant prices is.  The main point of contention is that someone can just take a screenshot of an image and claim they have a copy.  The problem with this is that they don't.  If you google the Mona Lisa and download a copy of the image onto your computer doesn't mean you own the original.  

However, in my opinion this initial craze will die down and we will being to see more utility in NFTs that will help regular artists monetize their work and earn passive income.  NFTs can be used for the following items:

- Digital content
- Gaming items
- Domain names
- Physical items
- Investments and collateral
