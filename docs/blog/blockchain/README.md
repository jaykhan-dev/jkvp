## Satoshi Nakamoto

On January 3rd, 2009, [Satoshi Nakamoto]() wrote this text when he minted the first Bitcoin.

>“The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”

This is imporant for many reasons:

- Centralized entities hold too much power and are only interested in their self-preservation
- Banks appear to have carte blanche to do as they like
- The regular people are the ones who suffer

The last point is what led Satoshi Nakamoto to create a new system free from the tyranny of centralized power.  Throughout history we have had systems and governements that consolidate their power in a capital city or state.  Since we are so used to this model, any other system (i.e. decentralized structures) are seen as suspect.  

It is not surprising that governments and banks don't like the Blockchain because it has the power to bring these legacy systems down.  In other words, if I was working in a bank, I would be anxious about the future of such corrupt systems. 

## What is a Blockchain?

A Blockchain is a **distributed digital ledger**.

From the main man, Satoshi: 

>A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.
