## Bio

This is where I was born, Kashmir.  It is in the western region of the Himalayan mountains.

Ever since I was a boy, I've been attracted to art.  Be that music, books, movies, or paintings, it is a constant source of inspiration.  I went to college and university
unsure of how to translate this love into a career and so I went with a program called *Interactive Multimedia and Design* that can be described as "jack-of-all-trades".  The main benefit of this allowed me to explore different avenues and then eventually pick one.  

After graduating, I found a job as a graphic designer and that solidified my commitment to creative expression.  After about 4-5 years of learning about typography, 
color theory, layouts, I wanted to create interactive experiences. After searching for a while, I found a UI/UX job and was hooked and realized this is what I want to do as a creative visual designer because the skills can be applied to any industry.  Eventually I decided to relearn JavaScript and after trying Vue JS with Django, I found the missing piece of the puzzle.
