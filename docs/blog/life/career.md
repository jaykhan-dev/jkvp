# Career 

## Upward movemnt
Since I left Montreal, I spent 2 months learning **Django and Docker**.  This has proved useful but it is not an employable skill due to lack of experience.  

- In November I started looking for work for real and make a WordPress portfolio site.  **This did not yield any positive results.** 

- In December, I started using Vue again and learnt the most important skill which is **consuming an API**.  This is essentially the way forward and what I am doing now.  

- January 2022 was the month of **Blockchain** and becoming an investor, doing tutorials and gathering important information.  

- February was when the interviews started happening.  All the jobs had a much **higher salary** than what I am used to.  

- For most of March, I was getting lots of attention but no offers as of yet.  I redid my portfolio in VuePress and found that soft skills are just as important as technical skills. I've always wanted to be a writer so this is my chance to make that known to the world and explore the depths of my own soul and bring forth the hidden treasure buried deep within.  

- April, I must dive deeper and stick to Vue JS for both web and mobile.  It is really just a continuation of is happening in March but with a more focused approach.  

## What does not work?
- Spreading yourself too thin
- Letting past failures affect your mood
- Putting too much trust and faith in recruiters when most of them are incompetent

## What works?
- exploring new technology is always a good thing but it has to serve a singular purpose
- Dicipline in learning and applying to jobs
- follow the money


## Perspective
- the job world is constantly moving because money is always moving too
- not every company is the right fit for me
- I want flexibility and better pay
- Consistency is the key to success
- I am an outsider still.  My name may automatically exclude me from certain jobs
- inner strength is found by rediscovering the source of power that comes from my last name
- sometimes getting lost can be the best way of finding new information that can change everything
- A rigid mind is detrimental to prosperity.  Be nimble and work efficiently
