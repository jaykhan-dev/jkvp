# Blog

This blog is broken down into the following categories

## [Blockchain](/blog/blockchain/)
Blockchain is a hot topic right now.  The industry is booming but still relatively new.  It is amazing how far it's come since January 3rd 2009, and it still feels like this is just the beginning. 

## [Programming](/blog/programming/)
More specifically related to Python and JavaScript as those are the only two languages that I use for personal or client based projects. I also use this blog to create reference material for later use. 

## Art
A general blog about the art world.  Topics include music, cinema, digital art etc.

## Life
Blogs about philosophy, travel, biographies, and just living in general.
