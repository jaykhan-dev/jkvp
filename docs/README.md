## Bio

Ever since I was a boy, I've been attracted to art.  Be that music, books, movies, or paintings, it is a constant source of inspiration.  I went to college and university
unsure of how to translate this love into a career and so I went with a program called *Interactive Multimedia and Design* that can be described as "jack-of-all-trades".  The main benefit of this allowed me to explore
different avenues and then eventually pick one.  

After graduating, I found a job as a graphic designer and that solidified my commitment to creative expression.  After about 4-5 years of learning about typography, 
color theory, layouts, I wanted to create interactive experiences. After searching for a few months, I found a UI/UX job and was hooked.

## Data

The internet is all about data.  In fact so much of ordinary life can be categorized as data in a digital sense.  Learning a programming language always involves learning
about data structures and algorithms.  This is important because if you don't have data, what are you programming?  

#### Headless CMS

I am familiar with the following CMS':
- Wagtail - based on Django and Python
- WordPress
