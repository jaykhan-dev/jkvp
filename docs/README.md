## Summary

### Creative visual designer
My expertise is in creating visual designs in the [**UI/UX**]() and [**graphic design**](/work/graphic-design) fields. I've worked as a freelancer and full-time employee in Agile environments. 
I understand the importance of UX and testing when it comes to design. 

### Goals and aspirations
- To create stunning responsive designs for web and mobile applications and pages.  
- Adapt web3 for legacy applications.
- Share and sell my art through blockchain technology.

## Bio

Ever since I was a boy, I've been attracted to art.  Be that music, books, movies, or paintings, it is a constant source of inspiration.  I went to college and university
unsure of how to translate this love into a career and so I went with a program called *Interactive Multimedia and Design* that can be described as "jack-of-all-trades".  The main benefit of this allowed me to explore
different avenues and then eventually pick one.  

After graduating, I found a job as a graphic designer and that solidified my commitment to creative expression.  After about 4-5 years of learning about typography, 
color theory, layouts, I wanted to create interactive experiences. After searching for a few months, I found a UI/UX job and was hooked.

## Web3

Web3 is the era we live in now in terms of the internet.  Techonology evolves and it is imperative that if you want to survive in this rapidly changing world, to
stay on top of things, ride the waves and learn to adapt.  Otherwise, the tide will take you. 

I am actively learning about web3 and how to design accordingly. 

## Data

The internet is all about data.  In fact so much of ordinary life can be categorized as data in a digital sense.  Learning a programming language always involves learning
about data structures and algorithms.  This is important because if you don't have data, what are you programming?  

#### Headless CMS

I am familiar with the following CMS':
- Wagtail - based on Django and Python
- WordPress
