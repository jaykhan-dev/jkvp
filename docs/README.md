## Summary

### Creative visual designer
My expertise is in creating visual designs in the [**UI/UX**](/work/uiux/) and [**graphic design**](/work/graphics) fields. I've worked as a freelancer and full-time employee in Agile environments. 
I understand the importance of UX and testing when it comes to design. 

### Goals and aspirations

- Adapt web3 for legacy applications.
- Share and sell my art through blockchain technology.

## Bio

This is where I was born.  Kashmir.

Ever since I was a boy, I've been attracted to art.  Be that music, books, movies, or paintings, it is a constant source of inspiration.  I went to college and university
unsure of how to translate this love into a career and so I went with a program called *Interactive Multimedia and Design* that can be described as "jack-of-all-trades".  The main benefit of this allowed me to explore different avenues and then eventually pick one.  

After graduating, I found a job as a graphic designer and that solidified my commitment to creative expression.  After about 4-5 years of learning about typography, 
color theory, layouts, I wanted to create interactive experiences. After searching for a while, I found a UI/UX job and was hooked and realized this is what I want to do as a creative visual designer because the skills can be applied to any industry.  Eventually I decided to relearn JavaScript and after trying Vue JS with Django, I found the missing piece of the puzzle.

## Web3
Web3 is the era we live in now in terms of the internet.  Techonology evolves and it is imperative that if you want to survive in this rapidly changing world, to
stay on top of things, ride the waves and learn to adapt.  Otherwise, the tide will take you. 

I am actively learning about web3 and how to design accordingly.  The main challenge is adapting blockchain for existing applications.  It is my belief that
companies will want to utilize this powerful technology seeing how slow and expensive traditional financial systems can be.  There is also a matter of trust.  

## Data
The internet is all about data.  In fact so much of ordinary life can be categorized as data in a digital sense.  Learning a programming language always involves learning
about data structures and algorithms.  This is important because if you don't have data, what are you programming?

For personal prjects I like to use [Python](https://www.python.org/) for managing data and creating data models with Django.  This is helped me immensely in understanding how the web works and allows me to create many Vue JS apps to level up my skills by practicing how to design user interfaces and user experiences.
